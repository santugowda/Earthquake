# Earthquake
Earthquake Listâ€©

* A simple Android application that will read JSON data from an earthquakes API and populate a RecyclerView within the main activity. 
* If the magnitude of the quake is equal or greater than 8, then distinguish these visually from other earthquakes in the list.  
* On click of the recyclerView item, open a Map fragment where I get the latitude and longitude from the JSON and show on the map.  
* Also, includes Unit tests and UI tests

Note : Ask was to refrain from using 3rd party libraries and code to handle the requests and responses.
